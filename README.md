Advanced language detection models for offensive contents detection in major Nigerian languages on social media


The proliferation of offensive language on social media is a global challenge, significantly impacting social dynamics and user experience. In Nigeria, where social media use is robust, this issue is particularly acute. This research seeks to address the gap in offensive language detection within the Nigerian context, focusing on the major Nigerian languages. This project aims to develop models capable of identifying offensive content. The urgency of this work is underscored by the potential of such online interactions to incite real-world violence. With the vast and growing volume of social media content, automated, accurate, and efficient language detection tools are essential. This research not only contributes to the digital safety of Nigerian social media users but also represents a significant advancement in computational linguistics for African languages.


# Lexicons
We have created lexicons for the three major Nigerian languages. These lexicons can be found in the lexicons folder. Each lexicon is provided in a separate file within the folder.
